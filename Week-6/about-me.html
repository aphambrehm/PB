              <div class="bit-columns">
                  <p class="intro"> If you're not from Washington. Then most people would say, "Yeah I'm from Seattle". Well for me I was actually born in Seattle at the Unviersity of Washington Medical Center then later moved to Kirkland, Washington. I've lived in Seattle only for a couple months and ever since I turned one year old, I've lived in Kirkland for 21 years.</p>
                  <blockquote>
                      <p>Kirkland is a city in King County, Washington, United States. A suburb east of Seattle, its population was 89,557 in a 2018 census estimate, which made it the sixth largest city in the county and the thirteenth largest in the state.</p>
                      <p>The city's downtown waterfront has restaurants, art galleries, a performing arts center, public parks, beaches, and a collection of public art, primarily bronze sculptures.</p>
                      <p>Kirkland was the original home of the Seattle Seahawks; the NFL team's headquarters and training facility were located at the Lake Washington Shipyard (now Carillon Point) along Lake Washington for their first ten seasons (1976â€“85), then at nearby Northwest University through 2007.
                      <p>Warehouse chain Costco previously had its headquarters in Kirkland. While Costco is now headquartered in Issaquah, the city is the namesake of its "Kirkland Signature" store brand.</p>
