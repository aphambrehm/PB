              <p>I chose this picture of me because when I see this its a picture of me and this website repsents me and my photography career.</p>
              <p>What's happening in this picture is me smoking (I don't smoke, it has no nic in the vape pen) and me blowing it out, while looking at the camera.</p>
              <p>The location of this picture is in Richmond, Canada. At the Richmond Night Market.</p>

          <section id="Richmond-Market"><p> This booth, I am at is 18+ to enter. Inside and outside had a clean look to it. Very clean and cripsy and a modern look to it. The roof top has a nice view of the whole market especially during sunset.</p></section>
